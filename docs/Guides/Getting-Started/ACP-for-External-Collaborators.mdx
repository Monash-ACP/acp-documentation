If your collaborator is a member of an Australian research/academic institution, they can just sign into our HPC ID portal using their AAF institutional credentials. The process for them to create an HPC ID account and join an M3 project is exactly the same as for Monash users.

If your collaborator is from a non-Australian institution and does not appear in our HPC ID portal, then the CI or the manager of the project must secure a Monash "visitor account" (e.g., ext-abcd@monash.edu) for them. Please see this Monash eSolutions accounts page for details on requesting a visitor account. Once they can access their visitor account, they can sign into our HPC ID portal via the Monash AAF pathway.

:::note
You should only request a visitor account if your collaborator's organization does not appear in our HPC ID portal.
