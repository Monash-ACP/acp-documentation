There are a few options to do that. First is:
- FileZilla
- rsync
    ```bash
    # To send files from local (e.g.: laptop) to Montage
    rsync [source_path] [user]@[ip-addr]:[dest_path]
    rsync text.txt u0001@10.168.151.1:/ibm/gpfs/u0001/Project1/

    # To copy from Montage back to my laptop
    rsync [user]@[ip-addr]:[source_path] [dest_path]
    rsync u0001@10.168.151.1:/ibm/gpfs/u0001/Project1/final_output.txt ./text.txt
    ```
    :::tip
    With rsync, there are some useful options. I usually do: `rsync -r --progress`, `-r` when it is a folder, and I want the transfer to be recursive; `--progress` shows the percentage of transfer per file, gives me an idea of how much longer it will take to complete data transfer.
