Yeah, we know, some projects will require a bit more storage space but here are some things to make sure you have enough space:

- You use python in your work? Have you `pip clear`? `conda clear --all`?
- Take advantage of the [shared resources](./Key-directories-on-ACP.mdx)?
- You know, maybe you can remove intermediate files that maybe you dont need?
    1. But make sure to keep log files as needed. These logs usually dont take much space, and you can diagnose the workflow you just executed.
    1. These logs will be important. Without being able to know what happened during the job execution, you might end up having to rerun the workflow, unnecessarily.


:::caution But Marcus, I really need that extra space

That is okay. Drop an issue on [iLab](https://mum.ilab.agilent.com/service_item/new/4628?spt_id=14652). We will evaluate your situation, we might ask questions. If everything is okay, we will grant that extra storage space you requested.
