## Basics
What are all the partitions we have?

```bash
sinfo
```

That is too long. How about a summary?

```bash
sinfo -s
```

What about nodes? Give me the node details.

```bash
sinfo -N
```

Check out `man sinfo` for more details.


## I just need a quick interactive session to check out my workflow

Okay, not how you supposed to use the ACP, but here you go; one quick interactive session into the `gpu` partition, one node, one task, reserving 8 Gb of RAM.

```bash
salloc --partition=gpu --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 --mem=8G
```

You probably will have to wait a bit to reserve that resource, wait until the queue can allocate the resource you requested.
