Okay, accessing GPUs may be slightly tricky. Of course, the partition you need to access would be the `gpu` partition. If you have a slurm script file, just add this SLURM config line at the top of your script.


```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

#SBATCH --parition=gpu

[... the rest of your code ...]

```
