There will be a few prerequisites here:
- You worked in the UNIX terminal before? Will need a bit of familiarity.
- Your wrote bash scripts? python scripts?
- Can you edit scripts while being in the ACP?
    - Maybe you grokked with NeoVim, or `nano` is fine for you?
    - Or maybe you figured out a way to sftp to the ACP via VSCode or Sublime?


If you did not tick to all of the above, yeah, git gud first.

Next, all you have to do, is just figure out the resources you need:
- How much RAM do you need?
- Will you need GPU?
- How long, at most, will you need to reserve the resource of individual jobs?

Once you figured that out, add the relevant SLURM lines in your script.


```bash
#SLURM ....

```
