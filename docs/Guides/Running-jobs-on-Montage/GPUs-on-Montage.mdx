GPUs are split into Multi-Instance GPUs (MIGs) to enable more users to access GPU resources; of course, the performance is also split too. However, the A100 GPUs in nodes mum-hpc2-gpu[5-6] do not have MIG enabled, reserved for users with urgent needs. These are only accessible under the Slurm `highprio` partition.

Accessing GPUs may be slightly tricky. Of course, the partition you need to access would be the `gpu` partition. If you have a slurm script file, just add this SLURM config line at the top of your script.


```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

#SBATCH --partition=gpu

[... the rest of your code ...]

```
