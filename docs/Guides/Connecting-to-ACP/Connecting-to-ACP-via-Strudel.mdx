Strudel is our home-grown solution for running remote desktops on M3. It allows you to connect to M3 from your web browser, rather than your terminal. For details on all of Strudel's features, see our Strudel docs. This page focuses on signing in to Strudel and running a terminal on a login node.

## Logging in to Strudel

Open [https://m3-desktop.erc.monash.edu/login](https://m3-desktop.erc.monash.edu/login) in your browser. You should see a login page like below.

<!-- TODO: Image of Strudel Login -->

From here, select "Choose a service" and then select M3 from the dropdown menu, and click Login. Sign in as usual to your Monash account via Google/Okta.

:::tip
If you do not have a Monash email, then please select the "AAF" option instead. If you cannot sign in via AAF, you will need to register for a Monash visitor account as described in our registration guide.
