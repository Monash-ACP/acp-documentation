:::info Just checking
1. You got your ACP account?
1. You are in Monash University Malaysia Network?
    - If you are outside of campus, connect via GlobalProtect on vpn.monash.edu.my
1. You know your account ID and password?
:::


1. Open a terminal.
1. Connect to the ACP:
    ```bash
    ssh [user]@[ip-addr]
    ssh u0001@10.168.151.1
    ```
1. Key in your ID and password.
   - When you type in your password, and you didnt see your letters getting typed, do not panic. That is how passwords are not exposed in Linux computers.
1. If you successfully got in, you will see this in your terminal.
    <!-- TODO: Add a successful login into Montage -->

:::tip
Maybe if you are comfortable with working in Linux, this is a tip for you. I **hate** remembering IP addresses, so you can actually register the address and give it a name:

1. From your home, there is probably a hidden folder named `.ssh/`
1. Create a file `.ssh/config`. Yes, the file doesnt have an extension.
1. Open with your favourite text editor, edit it:
    ```bash
    Host    [give-a-name]
        HostName    [the-ip-address]
        User    u0001
    
    # Sample
    Host    montage
        HostName    10.168.151.1
    ```
1. Save and close. Now, you can ssh with the given name:
    ```bash
    ssh u0001@montage
    ```
