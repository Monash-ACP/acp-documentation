1. SSH to Montage.
1. Lets open a screen.
    ```bash
    screen -ls       # Just checking if we have existing screens?
    screen -S jupy   # I am creating a new screen named 'jupy'
    ```
    - Great! You are in a screen. That way, your processes can still run in the background, even if you close the terminal window.
1. Open jupyter lab.
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
1. Take note of the port number.
<!-- TODO: Add picture of jupyter lab session, with port number -->
1. Exit the screen. Click `Ctrl-A`, then click `D`, to exit the screen.
1. Your jupyter lab session is now running in background.
1. Open your favourite internet browser. Go to:
    ```
    https://10.168.151.1:[port-number]
    ```
1. You are now in!

:::tip
I like JupyterLab, but if you prefer Jupyter Notebook, you can do that too. Just type `jupyter notebook` instead.
